# Minecraft server
- Host: 178.72.129.136
- Root user: root

# Workflow
- Use ssh while authenticating to minecraft server.
- Minecraft server version to download should be configurable.
- Don't forget about eula.txt rights consumption for first deploy minecraft server.
- I want to have configurable folder path to minecraft mods, that i want to deploy to the minecraft server. Perfectly, i want to have version of control (some public/local git repo to control mod set).
